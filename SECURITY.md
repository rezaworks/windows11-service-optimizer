## 📋 Best Practices & Safety Guidelines

**🚀 Follow these steps for the safest optimization experience.**

### 🛡️ Before Running the Script

#### **Step 1: Create System Restore Point**
```powershell
# Access through: System Properties → System Protection → Create
Enable-ComputerRestore -Drive "C:\"
Checkpoint-Computer -Description "Before Windows 11 Optimization"
```

#### **Step 2: Essential Preparations**
- **💾 **Complete Backup** - Ensure all important data is safely backed up
- **📋 **Service Review** - Examine and understand what will be disabled
- **🖥️ **Safe Testing** - Test on non-production systems when possible
- **⚡ **Power Management** - Ensure stable power during optimization

### ✅ After Running the Script

#### **Step 1: System Verification**
- **👀 Monitor Behavior** - Watch for any unexpected system changes
- **🔍 Verify Services** - Confirm which services were successfully disabled
- **🧪 Test Functionality** - Ensure critical applications work correctly
- **📝 Document Changes** - Record any observations for future reference

#### **Step 2: Performance Validation**
```powershell
# Check disabled services
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.StartType -eq "Disabled"}

# Monitor system performance
Get-Process | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 5

# Verify no critical services were affected
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running" -and $_.StartType -eq "Automatic"}
```
