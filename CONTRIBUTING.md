## 💻 PowerShell Script Guidelines

**Writing clean, maintainable PowerShell code for system optimization.**

### 🎨 Code Style Best Practices

- **🛡️ Error handling** - Include `try/catch` blocks for robust error management
- **📝 Clear naming** - Use descriptive variable names that explain their purpose
- **💬 Documentation** - Comment complex operations and business logic

### ⚙️ Service Management Standards
